Tuition Class Management System

This project was developed for an engineering technology tuition class, involving a real client. It centralizes all resources for the tuition class, offering features such as payable videos, practical timeslot scheduling, student assessments via quizzes, communication through the website, and reporting analysis for admins.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js, leveraging JavaScript (ES6+ syntax) for creating reusable UI components, managing state, and efficiently updating the DOM.

React Router DOM: For dynamic routing between different views or pages.
Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend.
Firebase: Utilized for authentication, storing videos and images, and file uploads.
SweetAlert2: For creating customizable, responsive alerts and messages.
FullCalendar: Integrated with React to manage and display calendar views and events.
Flowbite React: Provides responsive UI components styled with Tailwind CSS.
React Icons, React Modal, React Quill, React Datetime: For various UI components like icons, modals, text editors, and date-time pickers.
Backend: Node.js with Express, using JavaScript for server-side scripting to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

MySQL/MySQL2: A relational database management system for storing and managing data, with improved performance in MySQL2.
Nodemon: Automatically restarts the Node.js server upon detecting file changes.
Cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Multer: For handling file uploads in multipart/form-data format.
Cookie-Parser: Parses cookies attached to client requests.
JsonWebToken (JWT): For implementing secure authentication.
Nodemailer: For sending emails through various services and SMTP.
Path: A built-in Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
Development Tools and Technologies:

Postman: Used to test backend routes and API requests during development.
Visual Studio Code: The chosen IDE for development, optimized for building and debugging web applications.
JSON: Used for storing and transporting data, with seamless conversion to JavaScript objects, making it versatile for data exchange.
Project Phases:

Requirement Gathering and Documentation: Engaged with the client to gather detailed requirements and document the current process using various diagrams.
Design: Created detailed system diagrams to map out the functionality and data flow.
Development: Built the frontend with React.js, backend with Node.js and Express, and integrated MySQL for data management.
Deployment: Successfully deployed the system, which met all client needs, covering features like video hosting, practical session scheduling, and comprehensive reporting.
Learning Outcomes:
This project provided extensive hands-on experience with new tools and technologies, particularly in handling API requests, working with Firebase for file storage and authentication, and using third-party libraries like Nodemailer for email functionality. It enhanced both technical and project management skills, preparing for future projects of similar scope and complexity.
